# Hotspoter-V4
Hotspoter is special software that allows users to transform their computer into a wireless router. This is ideal for people who are looking for a way to use their existing internet connection to surf on their Smartphone, while the connection can also be shared with a large number of different people at the same time without weakening the signal strength.


# About This Project
   I created this project when I was 12 years old, way back in 2013 using Visual Basic .NET. I was looking for an alternative to a popular shareware on the internet, they were asking $18 USD, which was a huge amount for me at that time, as I had a pocket money of only $10 USD/month. So, that need pushed me to come up with this.


# Making the Best Connections
Even people who have never created their own Wi-Fi hotspot before should find that the task is easy with Hotspoter. Anyone who finds that they need a little extra assistance will also find that the software comes complete with a handy guide to steer them in the right direction. This means that users will not have to pay out for a separate internet connection for their mobile devices, while the software even promises to increase signal strength with a few simple tweaks so that users can download the data files that they need more quickly, enjoy more fluid video calls and perform other types of tasks such as surfing the net more smoothly and efficiently than ever before.


# Time to Get Connected
Although some software of this type have more features to use, Hotspoter works quickly and efficiently and delivers exactly what it promises. As this software is completely free to download and use, anyone who is search for a connection solution should make sure that they put Hotspoter through its paces.
